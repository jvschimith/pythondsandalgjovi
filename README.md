This present repository is a collection of resolutions, commentaries and considerations of all content of the book "Data structures and algorithms in Python" (link: https://nibmehub.com/opac-service/pdf/read/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20in%20Python.pdf).

O presente repositório é uma coleção de resoluções, comentários e considerações do livro "Estruturas de dados e algoritmos em Python" (link: https://nibmehub.com/opac-service/pdf/read/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20in%20Python.pdf).

In the first chapter, corresponding to folder "C1", we will cover about a Pyton overview, the basic syntax, control flow, functions, loops, exceptions, iterators and initial conveniences.

In the second chapter, we will be introduced to OOP in Python, that are, by the way, a little differente of the popular OOP languages, like Java and C#, but still utile.
