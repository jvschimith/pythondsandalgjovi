FR: Ce référentiel est un recueil de résolutions, de commentaires et de considérations tirés du livre « Data Structures and Algorithms in Python » (lien : https://nibmehub.com/opac-service/pdf/read/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20in%20Python.pdf).

In the first chapter, corresponding to folder "C1", we will cover about a Pyton overview, the basic syntax, control flow, functions, loops, exceptions, iterators and initial conveniences.

In the second chapter, we will be introduced to OOP in Python, that are, by the way, a little differente of the popular OOP languages, like Java and C#, but still utile.
